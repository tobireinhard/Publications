    abstract = {Programs for multiprocessor machines commonly perform busy-waiting for synchronisation. In this paper, we make a first step towards proving termination of such programs. We approximate (i) arbitrary waitable events by abrupt program termination and (ii) busy-waiting for events by busy-waiting to be abruptly terminated.  We propose a separation logic for modularly verifying termination (under fair scheduling) of programs where some threads eventually abruptly terminate the program, and other threads busy-wait for this to happen.},
